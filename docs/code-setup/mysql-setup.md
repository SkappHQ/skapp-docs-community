You might already have the experience in setting up mysql in your computer 
and it is just the basic setup which we need for Skapp.

If you already have mysql configured in your computer, 
we just need the username and password of your mysql server to proceed with the next step - <b>[Backend Setup](./backend-setup)</b>.

But if you don't have mysql installed in your computer, 
then you can simply follow the <b>[Mysql Official Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/)</b>
for all Windows, MacOS or Ubuntu operating systems.

Keep remember the username password you set for the mysql server since that is what we need for the next step.

Once you are done you can move to the next step - <b>[Backend Setup](./backend-setup)</b>.
