## Introduction

Holidays in **Skapp** are essential for accurate leave management and scheduling.

Bulk uploading holidays is recommended as the initial step when no holidays have been added yet for the selected year. Once the bulk upload is complete, individual holidays can be added or modified as needed.

## Handling Leave Requests Affected by Holidays

When holidays overlap with existing leave requests, the system adjusts the requests based on the holiday's duration:

:::note Full Day Holiday

- **Single Day Leave Request (Full Day)**:

  - Pending requests are canceled.
  - Approved requests are revoked.

- **Single Day Leave Request (Half Day)**:

  - Pending or approved requests are canceled/revoked if they conflict with the holiday.

- **Multi-Day Leave Request (Full Day)**:
  - The duration of pending and approved requests is adjusted.
  - Leave requests remain in their current status.  
    :::

:::note Half Day Holiday

- **If the Leave Request Matches the Holiday Half of the Day**:

  - Pending requests are canceled.
  - Approved requests are revoked.

- **If the Leave Request Is for the Opposite Half of the Day**:

  - The request remains in its current state (pending or approved).

- **Multi-Day Leave Request**:
  - The duration of pending and approved requests is adjusted.
  - Leave requests remain in their current status.  
    :::

### 2. Deleting Holidays

The system prevents deletion of holidays that conflict with leave requests. For partial deletions:
